# Future Agent Possibilities

This document outlines potential new agents that could be added to the Coquette system to enhance its capabilities.

## 1. Code Writing & Refactoring Agent

*   **Purpose:** To write new code, refactor existing code, and fix bugs.
*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   Takes a high-level description of the desired code or changes.
    *   Uses the `find_file` and `read_file` tools to understand the existing codebase.
    *   Generates a plan for the necessary code modifications.
    *   Uses the `write_file` and `replace` tools to implement the changes.
    *   Uses a `run_tests` tool to verify the changes.
*   **Example Usage:** "Add a new endpoint to the API that returns a list of users."

## 2. Web Search & Information Gathering Agent

*   **Purpose:** To search the web for information and synthesize it into a coherent response.
*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   Takes a user's question or research topic.
    *   Uses a `web_search` tool to find relevant articles and documents.
    *   Uses a `read_web_page` tool to extract the text from the most promising search results.
    *   Uses the `consolidateResults` pattern to synthesize the information from multiple sources into a single, well-written response.
*   **Example Usage:** "What are the latest advancements in AI-powered code generation?"

## 3. System Monitoring & Self-Healing Agent

*   **Purpose:** To monitor the health of the Coquette system and attempt to fix any problems that arise.
*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   Periodically checks the system logs for errors.
    *   If an error is detected, it uses the `ErrorRecoveryAgent` to attempt to fix it.
    *   If the error cannot be fixed automatically, it notifies the user.
*   **Example Usage:** This agent would run in the background and would not be directly invoked by the user.
